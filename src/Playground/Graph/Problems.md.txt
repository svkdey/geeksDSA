1.max number of changes  to be made to make grid disconneced?

111
101
111 ->we need max 2changes to make graph disconnected.
	now check 1. already disconnected ie no. of connected component is >1 .then op is 0.
	2.check if any articulation points in graph then op is 1
	else op is 2 .

2. course schedular 2.
solution . check if cycle while doing topological sorting
